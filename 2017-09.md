## In detail

## Categories API

### BREAKING CHANGE

We're adding an experimental Categories api and did some renaming in the event sourcing setup.
Additionally to the new database table which is created by the database migration script, we also renamed some columns on the menu and groups tables.
If your setup automatically applies the migration, there's nothing you have to do. If that's not the case, you'll need to run `grunt migrate`.

### API

```js
const categories = liServer.features.api('li-categories')

categories.getCategoryTrees({projectId, channelId}, cb)
categories.getPublishedCategoryTree({projectId, channelId}, cb)
categories.getPublishedCategoryTrees({projectId, channelId, categoryTreeId}, cb)

// required params for all methods: {action, projectId, channelId, categoryTreeId, data}
//` action` must equal the method name
categories.createCategoryTree({params..., data: {label}, cb)
categories.publishCategoryTree(params, cb)
categories.deleteCategoryTree(params, cb)
categories.addCategory({params..., data: {id, label, slug, pathToHere, metadata}}, cb)
categories.updateCategory({params..., data: {id, label, slug, pathToHere, metadata}}, cb)
categories.removeCategory({params..., data: {id}}, cb)
categories.moveCategory({params..., data: {id, previous, parent}}, cb)
```

## Enable metadata in import

The data object passed to the HugoImportApi can now contain a metadata object. E.g. NZZ can use it to pass their print metadata to the importer so an imported print article can be exported correctly.

## Removing deprecated doc-include methods

### BREAKING CHANGES

- The `registerServiceRenderer` method on the `server.features.api('li-includes')` feature was removed. Please use the `registerService` method, which was introduced in https://github.com/upfrontIO/livingdocs-server/pull/1470

- The method `includeApi.getServiceRendererMethod` got removed.
Please use `includeApi.resolveInclude` to render an include.

- We've removed the deprecated `/authenticate/pusher` endpoint. Please make sure your editor is up to date and that your pusher configuration isn't using that endpoint.  

- The url you should use  is `/pusher/authorize`:

  ```js
    pusher:
      isEnabled: true
      endpoint: '/pusher/authorize'
  ```

## `grunt-setup` works now properly within a docker container

- The config option `config.docker.enabled` has been replaced by `config.db.run_db_setup_commands_within_docker_container`.

- `config.db.run_db_setup_commands_within_docker_container` defaults to `true` and executes the db commands during `grunt setup` in a docker container. `grunt setup` is not supported, when you start docker containers with `docker-compose` and point to a container by a dns name.

- `config.db.run_db_setup_commands_within_docker_container = false` executes the db commands during `grunt setup` on the host system. For that `createdb` and `dropdb` needs to be available as binaries on the host system.

- the documentation has been updated as well: https://github.com/upfrontIO/livingdocs/pull/136/files.

## Update to new framework api

The framework's `livingdoc` objects has changed its signature with regard to removing event listerners. The following code does not work anymore:

    livingdoc.off()

It was replaced by:

    livingdoc.removeListener()

## Apply print layout change to document metadata

Each time when the metadata was applied to the document (e.g. `document.update()`) the metadata reference which was passed to the `MetadataService` in the `Workspace` went stale and metadata updates didn't arrive on the document.

## Define default image component on containers for drag & drop

### Feature: New defaultComponents configuration option

Image components can now also be defined as default components. A use case may be an image gallery where a different component should be used for images by default.

Example `component configuration` in a livingdocs design:
```js
{
  name: 'gallery',
  label: 'Image Gallery',
  directives: {
    children: {
      defaultComponents: {
        image: 'image-slide'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Feature: Browser Drag API

Interactive pages have a new `startBrowserDrag()` method. This method has an `onDrop` callback that provides a `dropLocation`.

```js
livingdoc.createView({host, interactive, wrapper}).then ({iframe, renderer}) => {
  renderer.page.startBrowserDrag({
    event: event,
    onDrop: ({event, dropLocation}) => {
      // getDefaultComponent() will return the defaultComponent for the droplocation.
      // Possible types are `editable` and `image`.
      const imageComponentName = dropLocation.getDefaultComponent({type: 'image'})
      const component = livingdoc.createComponent(imageComponentName)

      // insert can be called multiple times. It will append each inserted component at the
      // end of the dropLocation.
      dropLocation.insert(component)
    }
  })
}
```

## ComponentModel Api Improvements

### ComponentModel

Allow to call `setContent` with an object:
```js
componentModel.setContent({
  title: 'Moby Dick',
  tagline: 'Whaling Weekly'
})
```

Allow to call `getContent` without passing a directive name:
```js
componentModel.getContent()
// returns 
// {
//    title: 'Moby Dick'
//    tagline: 'Whaling Weekly'
// }
```

### ComponentTree

Allow to pass content when creating a component:
```js
componentTree.createComponent('title', {
  title: 'Moby Dick'
})
```

(this also works for `livingdoc.createComponentTree()`)

## Integrate Livingdocs release tools

* With the introduction of the `release-tools` it's possible to create and maintain a maintenance branch for an old version with a proper semantic-release approach. You can read more [here](https://github.com/upfrontIO/release-tools/blob/master/doc/how-to-handle-a-product-release-on-github.md).

* We introduced a check to verify that on a `maintenance` branch only patch commits are allowed.
