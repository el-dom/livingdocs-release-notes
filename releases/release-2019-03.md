# Highlights

## Recover Document :gift:

Sometimes it's possible that the editor comes into a conflict state. This can have different reasons. The most probable scenario is, that user 1 has a bad connection or works offline while another user is updating the document. When user 1 is back online and tries to save the document, he runs into a conflict.

User 1 will now be notified that the document has a conflict and get a link to recover the local document. If user 1 clicks on the recover link, a copy of his local document will be created.

## Custom Document Drag + Drop :gift:

The editor has some built in Drag & Drop implementations, to handle image, file and text drops onto a document. And It is possible to register your own drag & drop handlers.
Dropping objects over a dashboard is a separate subject.

## Merge users :gift:

A project admin can now merge n users into 1 in the editor.

## Remove editor reload and live updates in read-only mode :gift:

When you are switched to read-only mode, e.g. because another user is editing, then the screen
does not reload anymore and the position in the document stays as it is.
When you are in read-only mode, you also don't see live updates of other typing users anymore.
