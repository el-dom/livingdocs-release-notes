  # Highlights
  ## EXAMPLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Editor Multiselect :gift:
  Add multiselect functionality to the editor. In multiselect mode when a component is clicked this component is added to the selection. When a component is clicked again it is removed from the selection. In the sidebar the count of selected components is shown and there is the option to delete all selected components.
  Required editor configuration to enable the multiselect feature:
  ```js
  keyboardShortcuts: {
        '‚Üìshift': 'start multiselect mode',
        '‚Üëshift': 'end multiselect mode'
  }
  ```

  # Breaking Changes :fire:
  ## EXAMPLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Registration procedure :gift: :fire:
  There are two new flags per authentication connections: `loginEnabled` and `registrationEnabled`.
  The editor won't show the respective connection option in the login screen without them.
  Server `auth` configuration:
  ```js
  auth: {
    connections: {
      // email and password authentication
      local: {
        enabled: true,
        loginEnabled: true,
        registrationEnabled: true
        //...
      },
      github: {
        enabled: true,
        loginEnabled: false,
        registrationEnabled: false
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
  ```
