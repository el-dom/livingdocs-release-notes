- type: breaking change
- impact: this pr removes `grunt` and therefore also `grunt deploy`. This change has an impact on your setup in case you're using `grunt deploy` or any other `grunt` script. We've completely removed the script without replacement. In case you're using `grunt deploy` to deploy to s3, please use the s3 cli directly.
